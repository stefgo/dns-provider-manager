 * Turns an event into the sentence a reader sees -- on the dashboard and in a webhook alike.
 *
 * This is the one place a wording exists. An event carries facts (`kind`, `subject`, `data`)
 * and no sentence, so a wording can be changed here without touching what is stored.
 *
 * A kind nobody here knows still has to read as something: the fallback prints the kind
 * itself, because dropping the line would hide an event that cannot be recorded again.
